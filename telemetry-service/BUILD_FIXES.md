# Telemetry Service Build Errors - Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Main Function Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple `main` functions in the same package causing build failures
- `/telemetry-service/main.go` (primary application)
- `/telemetry-service/choreo-connection-example.go` (example code)
- `/telemetry-service/example/test_client.go` (test client)

**Error Message**:
```
./main.go:21:6: main redeclared in this block
./choreo-connection-example.go:10:6: other declaration of main
```

**Solution**:
- Moved `choreo-connection-example.go` to `example/choreo-connection-example.go.txt`
- Renamed with `.txt` extension to prevent Go compiler from processing it as Go source
- This preserves the example code for reference while avoiding conflicts

### 2. Component Schema Version Update
**Change**: Updated `component.yaml` schema version from `1.0` to `1.2`
- This aligns with the latest Choreo component schema requirements
- Ensures compatibility with newer Choreo features

### 3. Build Verification
**Local Testing**:
```bash
go build -v .          # ✅ Successfully builds
go test ./...          # ✅ No build conflicts
```

## Current Build Status
- **Previous Build**: 20000214430 (FAILED)
- **Current Build**: 20000214445 (IN PROGRESS)
- **Commit**: 6758d19a1e35416d4505f45804729457cfdbcb48
- **Triggered**: 2025-07-16T08:21:42.217Z

## Files Modified
1. `/telemetry-service/.choreo/component.yaml` - Updated schema version
2. `/telemetry-service/choreo-connection-example.go` → `/telemetry-service/example/choreo-connection-example.go.txt` - Moved and renamed
3. `/CHOREO_TELEMETRY_SETUP.md` - Added comprehensive documentation

## Expected Outcome
With these fixes, the telemetry service should:
- ✅ Build successfully in Choreo
- ✅ Use proper Choreo connection references for database access
- ✅ Deploy without conflicts
- ✅ Connect to the managed PostgreSQL database automatically

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the current build (20000214445) for completion
2. Verify successful deployment in development environment
3. Test database connectivity through API endpoints
4. Check application logs for any runtime issues
5. Generate and test API access using Choreo test keys

The build errors were primarily caused by Go language conflicts rather than Choreo-specific issues, and have been resolved by proper file organization and naming conventions.
