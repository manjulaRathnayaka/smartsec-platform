CVE-2025-24813

# Java Security Manager related considerations:
# When Security Manager is disabled, these types of vulnerabilities have increased impact:
# - File system access vulnerabilities (if present in dependencies)
# - Deserialization attacks (if application accepts serialized objects)
# - Code injection through reflection (if application uses dynamic loading)
#
# Note: No specific CVEs to ignore here, but risk profile changes
# Mitigation: Container isolation, input validation, and platform security
